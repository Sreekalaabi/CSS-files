                <p>  Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K.
                    Rowling. The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione
                    Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The
                    main story arc concerns Harry's conflict with Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become
                    immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic, and subjugate all
                    wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).</p>

                    Anglo-saxon poetry was circulated orally in a preliterate society, and gathered
                    at last into books over some six centuries before the Norman Conquest ended English independence.
                    Against the odds some of these books survive today. This anthology of prose translations covers most
                    of the surviving poetry, revealing a tradition which is outstanding among early medieval literatures
                    for its sophisticated exploration of the human condition in a mutable, finite, but wonderfully
                    diverse and meaning-filled world.

                   A Guide to Old English has established itself as the most thorough and most
                    stimulating introduction to the language of Anglo-Saxon England. This revised edition adds ten basic
                    texts, together with full notes and a comprehensive glossary, which convert the Guide into a
                    self-contained course book for students beginning a study of Old English. The texts, such as
                    Cynewulf and Cyneheard, the story of Caedmon and the conversion of Edwin, are those that have
                    traditionally been chosen by teachers precisely becasue they offer the best introduction to the
                    literature and culture of the time. They are arranged in order of increasing difficulty. The notes
                    and glossary constantly refer to the grammatical explanations in the Guide, so that course is fully
                    integrated and easy to follow.

                    Designed for introductory courses in Old English, Word-Hoard offers a vocabulary of some
                    2000 words drawn from the poems that beginning students normally read. Exploiting the natural
                    curiosity we feel about our own language, Stephen Barney draws etymological connections, provides
                    mnemonic aids, and introduces the student to cultural and literary concepts as well as words. This
                    second edition of his valuable book has been completely reset in a format that improves its clarity
                    and conciseness.

                    <li>Beowulf:</li> A Translation and Commentary:In a note discovered among his papers, J.R.R. Tolkien claims
                    to have "[put] it first into Old English".[3] However, Christopher Tolkien observes that this
                    sequence of events is inconsistent with the textual evidence, since the earliest manuscript of the
                    Modern English text was revised into a form that corresponds in several places to the Old English
                    text, which was thus probably based on a version of the Modern English tale.[7] The Old English
                    version as published is furthermore incomplete, breaking off before either of the two companions
                    faces Grendel. The Modern English text exists in three (partial) manuscripts and two typescripts;
                    Christopher Tolkien published the text of the later typescript along with the Old English
                    translation and a discussion of the tale's revision history in 2014.

                     <span style="font-weight: bold;">Leo Tolstoy</span>
                      (born August 28 [September 9, New Style], 1828, Yasnaya Polyana, 
                     Tula province, Russian Empire—died November 7 [November 20], 1910, Astapovo, Ryazan province) was a Russian author, 
                     a master of realistic fiction and one of the world’s greatest novelists.
                 
                 Tolstoy is best known for his two longest works, War and Peace (1865–69) and
                  Anna Karenina (1875–77), which are commonly regarded as among the finest novels ever written. 
                  War and Peace in particular seems virtually to define this form for many readers and critics. 
                  Among Tolstoy’s shorter works, The Death of Ivan Ilyich (1886) is usually classed among the best examples of the novella. 
                  Especially during his last three decades Tolstoy also achieved world renown as a moral and religious teacher.
                   His doctrine of nonresistance to evil had an important influence on Gandhi. Although Tolstoy’s religious ideas no 
                   longer command the respect they once did, interest in his life and personality has, if anything, increased over the years.
